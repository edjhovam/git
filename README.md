# Introduction
You are working at Acme Inc. Your team is building an MVP and you want to provide automated tests.

# Problem Statement
Implement three methods to the SeleniumExtractor class, which should use a Selenium WebDriver to extract information from the `src/test/resources/__files/index.html` page. 

1. Extract the test contents from the `<h1>` header at the `div` node with the `.container` class.
2. Click the `button` at the `.container` node and extract the URL link from the `<a>` element that has been created. After clicking the button, the handler fetches 
 a random link from the server.
3. Insert the text of the `paragraph` in the nested `div`.

# Setup
You can assume that the page is already loaded by the driver.
